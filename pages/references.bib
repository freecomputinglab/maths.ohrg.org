  abstract = {The article investigates the mathematical and philosophical backdrop of the digital ocean as contemporary model, moving from the digitalized ocean of Georg Cantor's set theory to that of Alan Turing's computation theory. It examines in Cantor what is arguably the most rigorous historical attempt to think the structural essence of the continuum, in order to clarify what disappears from the computational paradigm once Turing begins to advocate for the structural irrelevance of this ancient ground.}

  abstract = {``Mathematics is the science of the infinite'' (Weyl, ``The Current Epistemological Situation'' 123).1 With this pronouncement, the German mathematician Hermann Weyl opens his 1925 diagnostic essay, ``The Current Epistemological Situation in Mathematics'' (Die heutige Erkenntnislage in der Mathematik), which takes the measure of a contemporary situation identified elsewhere by Weyl as a ``foundational crisis'' (``On the New Foundational Crisis of Mathematics''). At issue for Weyl, as for many of his fellow mathematicians---whose positions he attempts to reconcile in his paper ---is the ongoing battle for dominion over an infinitely divisible continuum. That unbroken flow of experiential time and space, within which, as the Presocratic philosopher Anaxagoras had already observed by the 5th century BC, there is no smallest part of what is small, since there is always a smaller (Curd 38, fragment 3), poses seemingly insurmountable difficulties for an attempt to analyze the world into discrete, and thus calculable or measurable units. On the one hand: to eschew all such analysis is to relinquish the possibility of science, and perhaps even of language, since both activities would appear to depend on an intellectual capacity for delimiting particular phenomena. On the other hand: the contradictions generated by ignoring Anaxagoras' prohibition against a carved-up continuum (``the things in the one kosmos have not been separated from one another, nor hacked apart with an axe'' [Curd 51, fragment 8]) have dogged both philosophers and mathematicians for millenia.

  abstract = {How generative AI systems capture a core function of language Looking at the emergence of generative AI, Language Machines presents a new theory of meaning in language and computation, arguing that humanistic scholarship misconstrues how large language models (LLMs) function. Seeing LLMs as a convergence of computation and language, Leif Weatherby contends that AI does not simulate cognition, as widely believed, but rather creates culture. This evolution in language, he finds, is one that we are ill-prepared to evaluate, as what he terms ``remainder humanism'' counterproductively divides the human from the machine without drawing on established theories of representation that include both.  ~  To determine the consequences of using AI for language generation, Weatherby reads linguistic theory in conjunction with the algorithmic architecture of LLMs. He finds that generative AI captures the ways in which language is at first complex, cultural, and poetic, and only later referential, functional, and cognitive. This process is the semiotic hinge on which an emergent AI culture depends. Weatherby calls for a ``general poetics'' of computational cultural forms under the formal conditions of the algorithmic reproducibility of language.  ~  Locating the output of LLMs on a spectrum from poetry to ideology, Language Machines concludes that literary theory must be the backbone of a new rhetorical training for our linguistic-computational culture.},

To his previously published papers on chance, continuity, God, and other metaphysical themes, the editors have added a considerable number of unpublished manuscripts which clarify and develop the implications of Peirce's fundamental world-view. The volume contains those speculative views of Peirce which so deeply influenced his contemporaries, including his discussions of tychism and synechism and of the religious aspects of metaphysics.},
