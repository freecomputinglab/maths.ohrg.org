// THE ID PREFIX every note on this site is minted under, so a permalink reads
// `[maths:26-08-03]` and a reference is written `@maths:26-08-03`. rookery's own
// default is `idea`, which named the PACKAGE's vocabulary rather than this
// site's; a note here belongs to maths, and the id is the most-repeated piece of
// text on the page.
//
// SET IN TWO PLACES BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN BE COMPUTED. `#show: rookery`
// below takes it as `prefix:`, which is what mints the labels, and the two refs
// this file builds by hand read it from here — but a reference written in prose
// is Typst markup (`@maths:focus`), and no constant can reach inside that. So
// changing this is this line, the `prefix:` it feeds, and a sweep of the `@`
// forms across `content/`.
//
// WHAT IS NOT DERIVED FROM IT: the minted pages stay at `ideas/<slug>.html` and
// the CSS hooks stay `.idea-title`, `.idea-ref`, `.idea-tag-session` — both are
// constants in `@rookery/core`, not functions of the prefix. So no URL moved and
// no stylesheet changed with this rename; only the ids and the anchors did.
#let PREFIX = "maths"

// `page` is the minted `ideas/` page: every session shares the one
// `sessions.typ` vertebra, so that is the only per-session URL there is.
//
// `reading:` names the works read, and `authors:` the people who wrote them, by
// id (`<grayPlatosGhostModernist2008>`, `<sarah-pourciau>`) — declared as lists
// rather than written into the prose, so a session's record is data the note
// carries rather than a sentence someone remembered to type. Both are prepended
// as a header block rather than forwarded blind through `..args`, since they
// have to land BEFORE the given body. Each entry renders via `@id`'s own `ref`,
// so it takes that note's resolved title (the `show ref: hyperlink` rule
// `#show: rookery.with(...)` installs below) rather than a name typed twice.
//
// A READING ENTRY IS EITHER a bare id or `(id, pages)` — `(<grayPlatosGhost…>,
// "pp.18-38")` — the pages trailing the title as written. No ambiguity between
// the two forms, since one entry is always one work: an array is a work and its
// pages, never two works. The pages ride ALONGSIDE the ref rather than inside a
// Typst `cite` supplement (`@key[pp.18-38]`, which is what the prose used to
// carry) because a bare cite renders an anchor into a `#bibliography` this site
// never prints — a dead `#loc-1` link on every session that named page numbers.
//
// THE HEADER IS THE CITATION BLOCK'S TWIN. A citation note ends with
// `@rookery/bibtex`'s `bib-fields` — a muted label over a two-column table of
// the work's fields — and a session note opens with the same table of what was
// read, so the two take the SAME markup and therefore the same gutter,
// hairlines and label sizes for free: `.citation-fields-head` and
// `.citation-fields` are styled by bibtex.css, which every page links. As a
// `<p>` of body prose this read as a stray sentence rather than as the note's
// record. Only the spacing is the site's own — see `.session-fields` in
// style.css, since the package's gap is measured for a block that FOLLOWS prose.
//
// THE DATE IS A ROW HERE rather than the `== 3 August 2026` heading each body
// used to open with. It is the same kind of fact as the reading and the people,
// so it belongs in the same table, and a heading below that table would have
// stranded the session's date under its own metadata. It is formatted from
// `updated:`, which every session already carries, so no session states its
// date twice — and the two cannot now disagree.

// (`sessions`, `people`, `texts`) transclude these by tag instead, and each
// register stays reachable but unlisted. `ideas` is nested because its notes
