#idea(<prelude>)[
  #emph(doc-title) is an online reading group run by the #link("https://freecomputinglab.ohrg.org")[Free Computing Lab].
  We read texts at the interface of mathematics, philosophy, and history.
  See @maths:focus[our focus] for more info.

  We meet on an approximately bi-weekly basis during the academic semester.
  This fall (2026) we are meeting on *Wednesdays* at *12pm-1.15pm EST*.

  To join our mailing list, please email #link("mailto:maths@ohrg.org?subject=JOIN")[maths\@ohrg.org] with the subject header 'JOIN', and a 1-2 sentence explanation of your interest in the group.

// Split on build-time "now" rather than a tag: a session leaves this list of its
